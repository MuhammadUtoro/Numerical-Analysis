This repository is my learning tools for numerical analysis with Python.
Some of the exercises are taken from the Youtube channel of William D. Flannery, where he went through a numerical analysis using Matlab. However, in this repository I tried to solve the tasks using Python. Here is the link to his Youtube channel:
https://www.youtube.com/@wdflannery - There is a playlist called Computational Calculus and it is extremely useful to improve your programming knowledge
I am open for any suggestion from others who are insterested

Thank you
